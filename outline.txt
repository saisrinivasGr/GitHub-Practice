How does CVS version control work?

The CVS repository stores a complete copy of all the files and directories which are under
 version control. Normally, you never access any of the files in the repository directly.
 Instead, you use CVS commands to get your own copy of the files into a working directory,
 and then work on that copy.

Concurrent Versions System is a revision control system originally developed by Dick Grune in July 1986. CVS operates as a front end to RCS, an earlier system
which operates on single files.


What is a CVS module?
CVS modules are just symbolic names for sets of files, generally just symbolic names for a
particular directory in the repository. For example, the module "news-template" refers
to the path leland/news/template in the repository.
